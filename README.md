Mohamed AboElfotouh: Assigned tasks throughout the 3 milestones, implemented hasLeftChild(), hasRightChild(), hasParent(), isEmpty() & shiftUp() in priorityQ. Implemented > and cout overload in Node. Implemented the preliminary GUI that was presented in Milestone 2 including the homepage and the decompression/compression page.

Mohamed Dawood: Modified > and cout overload in Node. Implemented <, == in Node. Implemented getCapacity() in priorityQ. Impleneted generateFreqTable(), makeCode(), populate(), compress().

Omar Beshir: Implemented the decompression functionality, improved memory management and allocation throughout the project, standardized compressed file's output to improve decompression, debugged and fixed multiple minor and major errors in the codebase. Implemented the destructor in the heap's implementation to eliminate memory leaks, and rewrote the compression/decompression functionalities to include bit packing. Improved the GUI by displaying the file and its size.

Mahmoud Alaskndrani: Implemented priorityQ(), ~priorityQ(), push(), pop(), top(), getLeftChild(), getRightChild(), getParent(), shiftDown() in priorityQ. Implemented operator> in Node. Resolved merge conflicts and fixed resulting errors to ensure stability. Connected GUI to backend (created driver.cpp). Added large dataset for testing. Implemented file extension validation for compression (.txt) and decompression (.DAAB) with error handling in both GUI and backend.
