One of the simplest ways to code the output of a Burrows-Wheeler Transform is also one of the most effective. In this approach we put the output (such as that shown in Figure 3.1) through a “run-length encoder”, which takes advantage of runs of identical characters in a sequence, and then through an arithmetic coder, not unlike the approach shown in Figure 3.2. This method has been labeled RleAc(Ferragina et al., 2006a). Traditionally these are combined with other techniques (such as the move to-front list) that exploit the structure of the transformed text, but a some what surprising result is that with properly chosen parameters these two com ponents perform very well on their own. Run-length encoding (RLE) features strongly in much of the BWT research, and can be applied at almost any stage (including before the transform). However, most of the compression is achieved in the arithmetic coding, and there is some evidence that even the run-length encoding isn’t necessary if the arithmetic coding is done correctly, although RLE can make implementation simpler and faster.s
