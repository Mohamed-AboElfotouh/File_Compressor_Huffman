Data structures are fundamental to computer science and software engineering. Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs are essential data structures used in every programming project. Understanding how to select and implement appropriate data structures is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems. Sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort are fundamental to many applications. Searching algorithms help locate specific data in large datasets efficiently. Compression algorithms reduce file sizes by encoding data more compactly. These techniques form the foundation of modern computing.
